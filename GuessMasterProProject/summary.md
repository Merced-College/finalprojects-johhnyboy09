Project Summary:
I am building a terminal-based word guessing game called **GuessMaster Pro** using Java. So far, I’ve created the core game logic in a class that stores the hidden word, tracks guessed letters, and checks for a win condition. I also built a playable version with a `main()` method that runs in the terminal and lets users guess letters with feedback and guess tracking. I’m using a `Set` to store guessed letters, a `Stack` for guess history, and `Scanner` for user input. Next, I plan to add a recursive hint system, a scoring feature, and organize words by category using a hash table.
